                    Poetic devices are a form of literary device used in poetry. A poem is created out of <br>
                    poetic devices composite of: structural, grammatical, rhythmic, metrical, verbal, and visual <br>
                    elements. They are essential tools that a poet uses to create rhythm, enhance a <br>
                    poem's meaning, or intensify a mood or feeling.<br>
                    <br>

                    Poetic Diction is a style of writing in poetry which encompasses vocabulary, phrasing, <br>
                    and grammatical usage. Along with syntax, poetic diction functions in setting the tone, mood, <br>
                    and atmosphere of a poem to convey the poet's intention. Poetic devices shape a poem.<br>
