                    A basic distinction is between rhyme schemes that apply to a single stanza, and those that continue their <br>
                    pattern throughout an entire poem<br>
                    <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are also more elaborate related forms, like the sestina – which requires repetition of exact words <br>
                    in a complex pattern. Rhyming is not a mandatory feature of poetry; a four line stanza with non-rhyming <br>
                    lines could be described as using the scheme ABCD.<br>
                    <br>
                </p>       
                <p>
                    It is usually referred to by using letters to indicate which lines rhyme; lines designated with the same <br>
                    letter all rhyme with each other.<br>
                    <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    A rhyme scheme is the pattern of sounds that repeats at the end of a line or stanza. For example, the <br>
                    rhyme scheme ABAB means the first and third lines of a stanza, or the “A”s, rhyme with each other, and the <br>
                    second line rhymes with the fourth line, or the “B”s rhyme together<br>
                    <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Structure a poems message and thought patterns: For example, a simple couplet with a rhyme scheme of AABB <br>
                    lends itself to simpler direct ideas, because the resolution comes in the very next line. Essentially these <br>
                    couplets can be thought of as self-contained statements.<br>
