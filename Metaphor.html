                    A metaphor is a figure of speech that, for rhetorical effect, directly refers to one thing by mentioning another.<br>
                    It may provide (or obscure) clarity or identify hidden similarities between two different ideas.<br>
                    <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Metaphors are often compared with other types of figurative language, such as antithesis, hyperbole, metonymy and simile.<br>
                    <br>
                </p>       
                <p>
                    The word metaphor itself is a metaphor, coming from a Greek term meaning to "transfer" or "carry across". <br>
                    Metaphors "carry" meaning from one word, image, idea, or situation to another, linking them and creating a metaphor.<br>
                    <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    This quotation expresses a metaphor because the world is not literally a stage, and most humans are not <br>
                    literally actors and actresses playing roles. By asserting that the world is a stage, Shakespeare uses <br>
                    points of comparison between the world and a stage to convey an understanding about the mechanics of the <br>
                    world and the behavior of the people within it.<br>
