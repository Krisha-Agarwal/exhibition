                    In literature, alliteration is the conspicuous repetition of identical initial consonant sounds<br>
                    in successive or closely associated syllables within a group of words, even those spelled differently.<br>
                    As a method of linking words for effect, alliteration is also called head rhyme or initial rhyme<br>

                <p>The sound of alliteration can help create the mood or tone of a poem or piece of prose. For example,<br> 
                    repetition of the “s” sound often suggests a snake-like quality, implying slyness and danger. Softer <br>
                    sounds like “h” or “l” may create a more introspective or romantic mood or tone<br>
