                    If there is repetition of the same vowel or some similar vowels in literary work, especially in stressed <br>
                    syllables, this may be termed "vowel harmony" in poetry<br>
                    <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Assonance is a resemblance in the sounds of words/syllables either between their vowels or between <br>
                    their consonants. However, assonance between consonants is generally called consonance in American usage.<br>
                    <br>
                </p>       
                <p>
                    A special case of assonance is rhyme, in which the endings of words (generally beginning with the vowel <br>
                    sound of the last stressed syllable) are identicalâ€”as in fog and dog or history and mystery<br>
                    <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The two types are often combined, as between the words six and switch, in which the vowels are identical, <br>
                    and the consonants are similar but not completely identical.<br>
